# Reproducible Linux build + test of the wt Nix flake — NOT a runtime image.
#
# Lets you validate `nix build .#wt` (and its sandboxed Go test suite) on Linux
# without installing Nix locally:
#
#   docker build -t wt-nix .
#
# The build runs the full flake — including the sandboxed `go test ./...` check
# phase — and fails if anything regresses. `path:` is used instead of a git ref
# so it builds the working tree as-is (version falls back to "dev").
# Pinned by digest for reproducibility (nixos/nix:latest as of this commit).
